# Smite URL

A fast url shortener made with Swift & Vapor using Base58 encoding. My goal for this project was to learn how to make a URL shortener and to test out Vapor.

Other technologies used:
- Tailwind CSS
- Leaf (Templating for Vapor)
- Docker
- Redis


# TODO
Right now the app only has a caching layer, in the future I want to add Fluent - which is the ORM for Vapor, so that there is a permanent way of storing the already shortened URL's.
